# To Do

### Admin

- Intake export in csv format so edits can be made manaually and reimported


### Reports

- auto save onblur
- Reports view / edit from groups and build all if necessary to overcome set changes etc.
- Reports to reflect sl changes in text so that last minute group/course changes can be recorded

### Assessments

- remove isArchive from assessment_table ? Not really needed now - the archive vault shows all anyway
